    "Through the observation of the planets in our solar system astronomers have continued to calculated Earth's axial tilt with higher degrees of accuracy. I used the HORIZONS Web-Interface from JPL and NASA to get a year worth of data on Venus. After graphing Venus' position in our sky, I found that its' position moved sinusodial and  from this I was able to infer the angle of Earth's axial tilt is 23.77. However, the widely accepted tilt is 25.44 degrees. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make up for the error, I used vector geometry methods and Kepler's third law of planetary motion. I calculated the distance between Earth and the Sun using Kepler's laws. I was given the distance between Venus and Earth through the HORIZON database. I just needed the distance between the Sun and Venus which I found through the use of the seperation_3d function through astropy. Then using the law of cosines I found the angle between Venus and the Sun in our sky. Then, I took this and found the corrected axial tilt was 23.47 deg. This result was far closer than my original calculation. "
